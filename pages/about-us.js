                    At ICF International, we are a global consulting and technology services company that provides a wide range 
                        of services for governments and businesses. Our services include strategic planning, management, marketing, 
                        and analytics. We have a long history of providing our clients with the highest level of service. 
                        We were founded in 1969 as the Inner City Fund, with the purpose of financing and helping minority-owned businesses 
                        win government contracts. As we grew, we reorganized as a consulting firm and renamed ourselves ICF Incorporated. 
                        We focused on consulting on energy issues for U.S. federal agencies. We then expanded our capabilities by acquiring 
                        Kaiser Engineering in 1988 and going public in 1989, becoming known as ICF Kaiser. We split in 1999 and in 2006, 
                        we were renamed ICF International and went public on the NASDAQ. Since then, we have continued to grow through 
                        acquisitions and expanding our services.

                        such as the launch of the Coal and Electric Utilities Model, performing environmental and risk assessments for the 
                        EPA that led to the creation of Superfund, and implementing the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program. 
                        We have also worked with HUD and many other organizations. As of 2019, we had US $1.48 billion in revenue with

                                As we progressed and grew in the 1970s and 1980s, we made a significant shift in our focus from venture capital to 
                                    professional services and consulting. We became a trusted partner in policy economics and strategy, 
                                    specializing in areas such as energy, environment, public health, and economic development. 
                                    This shift marked a significant change in our operations and enabled us to provide more value to our clients,

                                    allowed us to expand our services and reach a global audience. We have acquired companies such as 
                                    London-based GHK Holding Limited, a consulting agency working with government and commercial clients, 
                                    which has enabled us to establish a strong presence in the international market and establish ourselves as a 
                                    leader in the industry. Going public in 2006 and accessing more capital through subsequent acquisitions has allowed
